# Quant-Trading-Practice-Project

In this project, I
•	Analyzed and visualized the return, volatility, skewness, kurtosis, and Sharpe ratio of multiple stocks using their historical data with python packages; determined covariance and correlation to measure the directional relationship between two asset returns	

•	Created portfolios of multiple stocks to picture the relationship and tradeoffs between the return and volatility, discovered the efficient frontier to see the best possible expected level of return for an intended level of risk using the Monte Carlo Simulation
